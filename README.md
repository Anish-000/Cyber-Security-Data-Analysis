1. Module Importing

Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NetworkX, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn are imported for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.


2. Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary attributes, standardized formats, and ensured dataset consistency.


3. Handling Missing Data

Managed missing values using imputation strategies and removal where appropriate.


4. Data Transformation

Applied normalization, encoding categorical values, and feature scaling for model readiness.


5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize suspicious activities, detect anomalies, and explore correlations.

NetworkX was used for graph-based relationship analysis of entities (users, IPs, events).


6. Random Forest Classifier

Implemented a Random Forest model for anomaly detection and classification.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


7. Neural Network

Built a Neural Network with TensorFlow to classify suspicious vs. benign activities.

Compared results with Random Forest for better insights.
